# Configuration files for rrsw are YAML files

# For details on the syntax see

#
# Supported keys: include and exclude
# Supported values: strings and Perl regular expressions 
#
# Exclude is processed before include therefore 
# excluded patterns take precedence over included ones
# 

# Never change or erase the next row!
---

# Process only targets that match these patterns
include:
 - ^/go/external2go
 - ^/go/gene-associations
 - ^/go/ontology

# Ignore matches to these patterns
exclude:
 - ^/go/gene-associations/submission
 - ^/go/ontology-archive
