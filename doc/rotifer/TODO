Pending issues/features for Rotifer

1 - Split in batches, add caching support and parallelize all
    downloads via a base download class????

2 - Split batch processing by Rotifer::DBIC::Parser::fasta 
    to avoid long runs resulting in no action: improve
    handling of transactions

3 - Add logging features (Log4perl???) to all Rotifer scripts
    or, at least, to rotiferDB
