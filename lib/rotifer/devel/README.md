Alpha and beta code for new Rotifer features
============================================

Directions
----------

- Use the alpha module to add any new function and modules regardless
  of code quality and testing

- Use the beta module for alpha code that has evolved into a prototyped
  API and is ready for exposure in a testing phase

Procedure
---------

1. Add you code to whatever file of you think is better inside alpha.
   __init__.py is the recommended file for preliminary ideas

2. Once you have had the chance to discuss your ideas with other people
   everybody may agree to move them to beta

3. Everybody should finally agree to move code to the definitive place
   outside of devel.
